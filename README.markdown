Every Rails developer has their favorite set of tools and gems. These just happen to be mine.

Setup includes:

- Active Admin, together with a super admin role to administer admin users. Endpoints are at  `/admin` and `/super_admins`.
- Deliver all your pivotal stories with `rake pivotal:deliver_all_finished`.
- RSpec, Factory Girl, Devise test helpers and Twitter Bootstrap setup and running.
